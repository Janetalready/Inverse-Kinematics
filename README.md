# Inverse-Kinematics
implement CCD/BFGS/Jacobian inverse for a certain DoF:

	- run {CCD/BFGS/Jacobian}_one_iter.m
implement CCD/BFGS/Jacobian inverse with varing DoF from 2 to 6:

	- run {CCD/BFGS/Jacobian}.m
plot curves for visualizing results over different degrees of freedom:

	- run plot_curve.m
